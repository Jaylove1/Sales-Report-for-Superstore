# DATA SOURCING

# DATA TRANSFORMATION 
----
Data Cleaning was first done which include removing duplicates, removing errors, cleaning pf empty/blank rows and changing of data type to the appropriate one.
The first row of each column was converted to the column header
The steps 1 and 2 were repeated for the queries/table in the dataset
After the transformation, the datasets were loaded on PowerBi for visualization 
But before I started visualization the data modelling was done on the datasets to link the various tables together to build a relationship between them.
To model the data successfully, I will need to identify the key column in all the tables that will serve as the basics for modelling.
When I was done with modelling, I created some measures and columns with Dax to make my visualization more fascinating and insightful.

# RECOMMEDATION 

The above findings and observations can be used for inventory control of the goods in store and also it can help in rewarding both bonuses to the sales team that performs better and discount to customers that bought more sales.
The organic sales team can be given a bonus for their exceptional performance 
The region with higher sales should be supplied with more stock, like the western region 
The goods in the store should be increased during the year-end because there are likely more sales during the periods 
Consumer goods should be made available all the time.
The supply of Canon 2200 cameras under the technology category should always be available because it generates more income for the store. 
Binders from the office equipment category should be made available because there is high demand for the product.
The consistent customers with higher sales should be rewarded at the end of each year and discounts should be offered to customers with higher sales.
