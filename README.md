# DATA SOURCING 
----

# DATA TRANSFORMATION 
----
Data Cleaning was first done which include removing duplicate, removing errors, cleaning pf empty/blank rows and changing of data type to appropriate one.
First row of each column was converted to column header
The steps 1 and 2 were repeated for the queries/table in the dataset
After the transformation the datasets were load on PowerBi for visualization 
But before I started visualization the data modelling was done on the datasets in order to link the various tables together so as to build relationship between them.
To model the data successful, I will need to identify the key column I all the tables that will serve as the basics for modeling.
When I am done with modelling, I created some measures and column with Dax to make my visualization more fascinating and insightful.
